# Abstract
This paper presents a comprehensive study of various key components required for an autonomous car, specifically focusing on Guidance, Control, and Sensors. The study covers aspects of reference path, control systems, and hardware implementation. The reference path is achieved through image processing of the location's map, taking into account the roads and the capability of performing curves. The control system is done using the Pure Pursuit algorithm and is responsible for controlling the vehicle's actuators and ensuring smooth navigation of the vehicle. The implementation of the sensors is merged through the use of an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), providing an estimate of the vehicle's position, velocity and attitude. Overall, the study provides a detailed overview of each component and how they work together to enable autonomous driving. The findings of this study can be used to inform the development of self-driving cars and other autonomous vehicle systems.
